1. The trace did not produce the correct mathematical result due to the line: 
544dfc	4a 8d 04 a5 02 00 00 00	lea 0x2(,%r12,4),%rax
The lea instruction multiples %r12 by 4, which should have multiplied 0xdfffffffdceaced0 by 4, but this number overflows since it is not in the range of a long. It produces ~6.47 * 10^19, which is greater than the largest value allowed for a long, 2^64-1. This results in overflow, which is not handled correctly through emacs.

2. In the Emacs source code in data.c, we can find that the most negative number in the following lines:
DEFVAR_LISP ("most-negative-fixnum", Vmost_negative_fixnum,
	       doc: /* The smallest value that is representable in a Lisp integer.  */);
  Vmost_negative_fixnum = make_number (MOST_NEGATIVE_FIXNUM);
  XSYMBOL (intern_c_string ("most-negative-fixnum"))->constant = 1;

Looking in the lisp.h folder, we find that MOST_NEGATIVE_FIXNUM is defined in the line: 
#define MOST_NEGATIVE_FIXNUM (-1 - MOST_POSITIVE_FIXNUM)
And MOST_POSITIVE_FIXNUM is defined as :
#define MOST_POSITIVE_FIXNUM (EMACS_INT_MAX >> INTTYPEBITS)

We can also see that EMACS_INT_MAX is equal to INT_MAX, which is equal to 2^63-1 in x86-64, or 9.223372e+18 due to the following line. 
#  define EMACS_INT_MAX INT_MAX

This value is then shifted over by INTTYPEBITS, which is defined as INTTYPEBITS = GCTYPEBITS - 1 and equal to 2. By shifting over INT_MAX 2 to the right, we divide by 2^2 and receive the value 2305843009213693951. To find MOST_NEGATIVE_FIXNUM we just use the previous define statement, or -1 - 2305843009213693951, which results in the number we see: -2305843009213693952.

3. The command is multiplying four “most-positive-fixnum”s together, and from question 2, we can see that most-positive-fixnum is equal to 2^61-1. By multiplying four of these together, we are essentially taking (2^61-1)^4, and all the terms except for (2^61)^0*(-1)^4 will overflow since they exceed the maximum value for a long. Thus the only term left will be the last term, which is 1. The number is truncated and the last 64 bits consists of all 0’s and 1 at the end.

4. Using -fwrapv will not check for overflow but will wrap around if the result overflows. The program will still run, but the output will still be incorrect.

5. When I run the code in gdb and set disassemble-next-line on, I encounter an error message with the free() function:

I used the command “info locals” to see what is stored in the local variables, and I see that the strings overflow when they are copied by the function strcpy. With the backtrace, I saw that there is an error in time_rz.c, which is in the lib directory. I looked into the source code and find the lib directory to open up time_rz.c and analyzed time_zonet’s allocation:
timezone_t
tzalloc (char const *name)
{
  size_t name_size = name ? strlen (name) + 1 : 0;
  size_t abbr_size = name_size < ABBR_SIZE_MIN ? ABBR_SIZE_MIN : name_size + 1;
  timezone_t tz = malloc (offsetof (struct tm_zone, abbrs) + abbr_size);
  if (tz)
    {
      tz->next = NULL;
#if HAVE_TZNAME && !HAVE_TM_ZONE
      tz->tzname_copy[0] = tz->tzname_copy[1] = NULL;
#endif
      tz->tz_is_set = !!name;
      tz->abbrs[0] = '\0';
      if (name)
        extend_abbrs (tz->abbrs, name, name_size);
    }
  return tz;
}

By analyzing this code, I see that the program is attempting to copy over code, but the memory sources overlap due to overflow. It is attempting to copy over a NULL since the size of the destination array is unable to hold the C string in the source. The strings overlaps in memory.
